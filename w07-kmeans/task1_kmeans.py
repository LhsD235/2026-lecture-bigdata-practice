"""Week 7 · Task 1 — k-means, and the thing that decides the answer.

Textbook §7.1 (clustering, the curse of dimensionality), §7.3 (k-means).

k-means is four lines: pick centroids, assign every point to the nearest one,
move each centroid to the mean of its points, repeat. It always converges.

It converges to a **local** optimum, and which one depends entirely on where you
started. That is not a footnote - it is the difference between a clustering that
means something and one that does not, and you can watch it happen on nine points.
